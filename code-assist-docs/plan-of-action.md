# Plan of Action for Lord of the Rings SDK Development

This document outlines the agreed-upon plan for developing the Lord of the Rings SDK. The development will be guided by the principles observed in the `sdk/logs/lib-lab-sdk` project, focusing on a walking skeleton approach, early CI setup, and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Current Plan:

1.  **Inspect `sdk/logs/lib-lab-sdk`**: Examine the structure, build process, and example usage of the `sdk/logs/lib-lab-sdk` project to inform our approach. (Completed: Analysis of `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `architecture.md`, `README.md`, and `.env.example` has been performed.)
2.  **Initialize a new TypeScript project (Walking Skeleton)**: Set up `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`, and create a minimal project structure.
3.  **Implement a single API call (Walking Skeleton)**: Implement a basic API call to the Lord of the Rings API and log its response to the console, ensuring end-to-end connectivity.
4.  **Set up GitHub Actions CI**: Create the necessary configuration files for a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.
5.  **Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Once the CI pipeline is confirmed to be working, switch to a TDD approach for building out the remaining SDK functionality, including filtering capabilities.
6.  **Update Documentation**: Modify `README.md` with usage instructions and `design.md` with SDK design details.
7.  **Create Example Usage**: Develop a demonstration file to showcase the SDK's functionality.

## Important Details for Future Reference:

*   **Project Context**: The current working directory `/home/todd/Dev/lib-lab-take-home-project-sr-ca43060fa84a40c7ba89fd0f5a001140` is referred to as `sdk`.
*   **Core Task**: Build a new TypeScript SDK for the Lord of the Rings API, specifically for `/movie` and `/quote` endpoints.
*   **No Code Generation**: Strictly avoid using any code generation tools (e.g., OpenAPI Generator).
*   **Guidance and Verification**: The Gemini CLI will guide through each step, make recommendations, and verify progress.
*   **Reference Project**: The `sdk/logs/lib-lab-sdk` project serves as a reference for best practices in terms of project structure, build process (using `tsup`), testing (using `tsc --noEmit`), and documentation.
*   **Walking Skeleton**: The initial focus is on getting a minimal, end-to-end working API call to establish connectivity and a basic build/run process.
*   **CI First**: After the walking skeleton, the priority is to set up a GitHub Actions CI pipeline before proceeding with full feature development.
*   **TDD**: Once CI is in place, all subsequent feature development will follow a Test-Driven Development approach.
